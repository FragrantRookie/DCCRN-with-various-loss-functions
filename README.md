# DCCRN with various loss functions

DCCRN(Deep Complex Convolutional Recurrent Network) is one of the deep neaural networks proposed at [1]. This repository is an application using DCCRN with various loss functions. Our original paper can be found here, and you can check the test samples here.

# Loss functions
We use two base loss functions and two perceptual loss functions.
1. MSE: Mean Squred Error
