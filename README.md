# DCCRN with various loss functions

DCCRN(Deep Complex Convolutional Recurrent Network) is one of the deep neaural networks proposed [1]. This repository is an application of DCCRN with various loss functions. Our original paper can be found here, and you can check the test samples here.

# Loss functions
We use two base loss functions and two perceptual loss functions.
1. MSE: Mean Squred Error

2. SI-SNR: Scale Invariant Source-to-Noise Ratio

1. LMS: Log Mel Spectra
2. PMSQE: Perceptual Metric for Speech Quality Evaluation

# Prepare training data

# Use pretrained models
